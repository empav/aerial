The recommended workflow is to build it:

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

```bash
npm run build # or yarn build
```

This builds to `/dist`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```bash
npm run storybook # or yarn storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.
